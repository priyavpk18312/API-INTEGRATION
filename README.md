**DISCRIPTION:
           This project is developed as part of CODTECH Internship – Task 1, where the objective is to create a responsive webpage that fetches and displays real-time data from a public API using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The webpage dynamically loads information through the Fetch API and presents it in a clean, user-friendly interface. This task helps in understanding API integration, working with JSON data, and building interactive web applications.
